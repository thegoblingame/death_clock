So I need you to make one modification to the site. Currently the functionality works as follows. The user inputs a number and then they are given a clock that counts down from that number. However, the flaw that we have right now is that whenever the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens the page, it resets the timer. I don't want it to work that way. I am now going to describe what I need you to change to rectify this issue. On the second view, I need you to subtract the current time from the number provided by the user in the first view. So for example, let us imagine that in the first view, the user had input the number 1, so they would have 1 year or 365 days. Now, in that case, if the user were to go to the second view, they would see a clock that counts down from 365 days. But let us imagine that the user were to close the page for and then come back after 10 days had passed. In that case, we would want the clock to count down from 355 days So in other words, what I need you to do is convert both the number that the user has given to you and the current time when the user visits the second view and subtract the current time from the number that has been provided from the user. Does that make sense? Please ask me if you need any more clarification. Thank you.
